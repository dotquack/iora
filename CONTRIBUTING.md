# Contributing
This files contains some guidelines we want you follow when contributing to iora.

Note that the "i" in "iora" should be lowercase, the exceptions are when it's at the beginning of a sentence or in a title.  Although if it stands alone in a title, make it lowercase regardless...

Some examples:

 - "I love iora."
 - "Iora is great."
 - "An Introduction to Iora"
 - "iora"

## Issues
  - Try searching the issue before creating it.
  - Please list your operating system and iora version (and dependency versions) in your issue.  You can get version info with `iora version`.

## Pull requests
  - Make sure your code has been linted with the `.jshintrc` file at the repo's root.  You'll need JSHint in order to do this.  If you're using Atom, I recommend the [`linter`](https://atom.io/packages/linter) and [`linter-jshint`](https://atom.io/packages/linter-jshint) packages to do this whilst you're developing.
  - Look at the coding style already presented and try to implement your code in a similar or the same style.  This is for future contributors, so they don't have to learn a bunch of different styles.
  - If you're adding a feature, open an issue so we can discuss it before you develop it.  This way if we decide not to implement it, you haven't wasted all that time developing.
